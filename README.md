This repository works in conjuntion with [this youtube playlist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XrARC7_AI1o&list=PLGOV23vyIt6aF0HvNFEpG2EdxZW0rIbd2), showcasing how
testdriven development can be done in Unity.

The repository has a tag for each tutorial respectively. They represent the
final product of that tutorial. If you want to follow the tutorial along, simply
checkout the tag before that tutorial. For Tutorial 1 it would be `init`. For
Tutorial 2 it would be `tut-1` and so on.
